# Contributing Guidelines

First off â€” thanks for wanting to contribute! ðŸŽ‰  
We want to make it easy for you to jump in and keep things consistent, so hereâ€™s how we work.

---

### Branching Strategy

We use a **feature-branch workflow**:

- **`develop`** â†’ Latest merged work, ready for QA.  
- **Feature branches** â†’ For new features or fixes.  

We use conventional branches and conventional commits. Check out the docs on them [here](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) and [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
**Naming your branch**  
Please use this format:

### Github Actions and Ci-Cd
We are using github actions for our CI-CD pipeline.
To test locally one may use `act` check it out [here](https://nektosact.com/installation/).
Testing locally relies on secrets being supplied to the runner. We pass this in with a `repo.secrets` env file. 
The secrets suppied contain config for the runner to login to dockerhub and deploy on Google Cloud Run but also the frontend env vars as NextJS requires these at build time. (we cannot supply them into cloud run). Read more about this [here](../frontend/nextjs.md)

Contact the Admins to supply you with the file. It belongs in the repo root dir. For completeness, here is a sample :)

```
export DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN='dckr_*****'
export DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME='*****'
export GCP_PROJECT_ID='****'
export NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='*****'
export CLERK_SECRET_KEY='*****'
```

We have layered an abstraction atop of act via a makefile with some sensible defaults although we highly recommend checking out the docs for your own implementations and testing.

### Read the Docs and Sphinx
The easiest way to get started with the docs is by using the makefile in the root dir. Simply `make build-docs` to build and update the docs, and `make view-docs` to check it out.  
If all is well it should work and on successfully merging into develop it will get deployed to our livesite at [https://software-design-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://software-design-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
