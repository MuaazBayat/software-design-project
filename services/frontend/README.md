Components must be in `/components/` and not `/components/ui/` use standard React nomenclature ie. lowercase-kebab for files and CamelCase for components.


Please use branches with the following best practice naming:
`feature/<your-branch-name-here` or `chore/<your-branch-name-here>` also commits should be descriptive. We will not take `some stuff` and `blank` commits.

Happy Coding :)
